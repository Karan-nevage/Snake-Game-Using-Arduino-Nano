The program you’ve written is for a Snake game that runs on an Arduino and is displayed on an OLED screen.
It starts by including the necessary libraries for the OLED display and defining global variables for the game. 
The joystick’s analog values are read in the keyScan function, which sets the snake’s direction. The draw_snake 
function is responsible for drawing a block of the snake on the OLED display at the given coordinates.
The show_score function displays the score at the given coordinates on the OLED display.

The screen function clears the display, draws the game area, displays the level and score, and draws the snake 
and food on the OLED display. The draw_food function generates a new food location if the previous food has been
eaten, ensuring that the new food location is not inside the snake’s body. The snake_move function updates the 
snake’s head position based on its direction, checks if the snake has eaten the food, and updates the snake’s
body position. It also calls the function to check if the snake has died.

The draw_game_over function displays the “GAME OVER” message along with the final level and score on the OLED 
display. The check_snake_die function checks if the snake has hit the wall or eaten itself, and sets the game_over
variable to true if either condition is met. The setup function initializes the OLED display and sets the random
seed for the food location. Finally, the loop function is the main game loop. It calls the key scan, snake move, 
draw food, and screen functions in each iteration. If the game is over, 
it calls the draw game over function instead.
